PersonalEnvironment
===================

The goal of this repository is to easily access and install my Work environment.
The installation process is via a Makefile.

--------------
I am currently using it to :
+ Install Sublime text 3
+ Install Package Control
+ Install some Packages (the ones lists in **Package Control.sublime-settings**)

In the future I want to use it to :
+ Configure all the packages
+ install third part tools such as phpmd
+ Not limit it to Sublime Text (merge with PersonalVimConfiguration repository)
